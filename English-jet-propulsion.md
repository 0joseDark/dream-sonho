- design of a gas engine, without moving parts, controlled electronically and by software.
# let's go step by step:
1 the gas engine:
2 the gas used:
3 engine ignition:
 - electrical initiation:
4th electronics:
- - used a raspberry py or arduino:
- - program in C or C++ for arduino:
- - make the program for arduino, and test.
