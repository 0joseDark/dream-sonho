**- Project of a Gas Motor, Without Moving Parts, Electronically and Software-Controlled.**  

# Let's go step by step:  

1. **The gas motor:** A jet engine without moving parts.  
2. **The gas used:** Hydrogen, methane, and oxygen.  
3. **Engine ignition:** Using a spark plug for ignition.  
   - **Electric ignition:** Using solenoid valves for gas, controlled by Raspberry Pi and Arduino.  
4. **Electronics:**  
   - Using a Raspberry Pi 5B or Arduino Mega.  
   - Program in C or C++ for the Arduino.  
   - Develop and test the program for the Arduino.  

## **Engine Diagram**  

1. **General engine diagram:** I will start with the most basic setup and test it in a vacuum to see if it works.  
   - **Basic engine design:**  
     - ![Gas or liquid motor](https://github.com/0joseDark/dream/blob/main/teste_de_desenho-motor_de_combustao-1.jpg)  
   - I will begin testing in a controlled environment.
