 - book, under construction
 - hello, I have a dream, and talents, eyes that deconstruct, while animals live or machines, I have the dream, to send machines to Mars to build for humans
 - My idea is to improve what has already been done and explore new possibilities, such as bots and robots.
 - We have AI tools; we just need to use them to create intelligent bots/robots that can be driven.
 - We can explore different approaches to make AI more efficient and interactive, applying it to controllable robots.
