# Biography

## About Me
I am a researcher and a true idealist because I am always coming up with new ideas! I can't stop; I am always studying something new.

My passion lies in biology and sciences. I started studying living beings, animals, and plants very early and discovered that they function like perfect machines.

## Education and Experience

- Since childhood, I have always been fascinated by dismantling and understanding how things work. At just 11 years old, I started taking apart radios to learn their construction.
- At 14, I took my first electronics course.
- In 1984, at the age of 17, I completed a digital electronics course and acquired my first computer: a ZX Spectrum with 48K.
  - On it, I started programming in BASIC and created a robotic arm controlled by the computerâ€™s keys.
- Later, I acquired a 486DX computer with a 100MB hard drive, running MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows.
  - With this system, I programmed in QBasic and started compiling programs.
- I took several additional courses, including:
  - Digital electronics: learning about CPUs 8080 and 8085, memory, and controllers.
  - Assembly programming.
  - In-depth study of 8086, 8088, and 486DX processors.
  - Industrial automation and robotics.
  - Study of Microchip microcontrollers.
  - Development of scripts in C and C++.

## Professional Experience

- At 14, I started working as a locksmith, but my desire was to work in the electrical field.
- At 17, I worked as an electromechanical assistant in a factory.
- I worked in painting at the Portuguese Navy School in Vila Franca, where I tried to enlist but was unable to submit the documents in time.
- My true passion was telecommunications.
- I worked in various fields, such as:
  - Carpentry (including courses and work in furniture factories).
  - Electromechanics.
  - Volunteering at church, helping people.
  - Mechanical locksmithing, assembling, and repairing construction machinery.
  - Study of fluid mechanics and turbines.
  - Manufacturing coils and transformers, along with the study of power electronics.

## Technologies and Recent Studies

- Study of IIS servers on Windows, creating web pages in ASP.
- Experience with Windows 2000 and 2003 Server.
- Knowledge in SQL and MySQL.
- Administration of Apache and IIS servers, development of web pages in PHP.
- Implementation of Linux and Windows clusters.
- Use of OpenSUSE KDE as my preferred operating system.
- Experience with Debian and Ubuntu (I currently use Ubuntu due to Python support and the extensive documentation available).
- Investment in hardware and programming:
  - Acquisition of two Arduino Mega and a Raspberry Pi 3B.
  - Hardware testing and software development.
  - Studying Python for real-time robot programming and AI integration.
  - Plans to use a Raspberry Pi 5B together with Arduino as a peripheral.
  - Development of a robot with legs.

## Personal Projects and Achievements

- Construction of houses and furniture.
- Repair of household appliances and industrial machines.
- Continuous development in electronics, mechanics, programming, and automation.

My journey is marked by the constant pursuit of knowledge and a passion for technology and innovation!
