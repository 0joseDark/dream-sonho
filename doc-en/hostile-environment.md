## Why Not the Moon, but the Asteroids?

The Moon might seem like a good place for exploration, but it presents significant challenges. The biggest problem is its abrasive dust, which is extremely hostile to both living beings and machines. This dust, similar to ground glass, causes a lot of friction and can damage space suits and equipment. Moreover, the Moon has never had liquid water to polish its volcanic rocks, unlike Earth, where river and ocean sand becomes rounded and less aggressive.

Asteroids, on the other hand, offer considerable advantages:

- **Zero gravity and no friction**, making mechanical operations easier.  
- **Availability of water and metals**, essential for generating energy and building spacecraft.  
- **Remote exploration**, reducing human risks.  

### Automation and Safety

Simply leaving Earth is already a major risk, comparable to crossing several busy highways during rush hour, combined with the danger of space debris. However, machines can take on these challenges without putting human lives at risk.

Although building a space factory is expensive, it can be assembled in modules and leveraged in zero gravity. This way, asteroids can provide everything needed for interplanetary travel.

### Mars: A Promising but Dangerous Destination

Mars is an interesting planet because it has reasonable gravity and evidence of liquid water in its past or even present. However, sending astronauts there without proper infrastructure is madness.

To survive on Mars, we need:  
- **Water and food**  
- **Stable temperatures**  
- **Building materials**  
- **Protection from solar radiation**  

All of this can be prepared in advance by remotely operated machines, minimizing risks. Sending humans without this preparation would be a serious mistakeâ€”after months in zero gravity, our bodies would face a hostile and dangerous environment.  

Such a mission might appeal to extreme sports enthusiasts, but in reality, it would be almost suicidal. We should let machines do the hard work before setting foot on Mars.
